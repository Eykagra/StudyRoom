## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A free [MongoDB Atlas](https://mongodb.com/atlas) account

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
# Install server dependencies
cd study-room/server
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

**`study-room/server/.env`**
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/studyroom
JWT_SECRET=your-access-token-secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-refresh-token-secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=15m
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
PORT=4000
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

**`study-room/client/.env`**
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

### 3. Run

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend
cd study-room/server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — frontend
cd study-room/client
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Core Features

All mandatory requirements from the assessment are implemented:

### ✅ Authentication
- Register / Login / Logout
- JWT access token (15 min) stored in memory (Zustand + sessionStorage)
- Refresh token (7 days) in httpOnly cookie with automatic rotation
- Silent token refresh via Axios interceptor — failed 401s retry automatically
- Auth persists across page refreshes and new tabs via sessionStorage

### ✅ Study Room Management
- Create rooms with name and optional description
- Join via shareable invite link (`/join/:inviteCode`)
- Edit room name/description (owner only)
- Delete room with confirmation modal (owner only)
- Search and filter rooms (All / My rooms / Joined)

### ✅ Session Timer
- Per-user independent timers — each participant tracks their own study time
- Start, Pause, Resume, End controls
- Timer persists across page refreshes (server-authoritative)
- Session auto-saved if user disconnects mid-session
- Session end celebration modal with confetti animation

### ✅ Room Chat
- Real-time messaging via Socket.io
- WhatsApp-style left/right bubble layout
- Grouped messages (consecutive messages from same sender)
- Typing indicators with 2-second debounce
- Cursor-based message pagination (load earlier messages)
- Optimistic message send with server reconciliation

### ✅ Real-time Room Updates
- Live presence indicators (🟢 Studying X min / 🟡 Paused / ⚫ Offline)
- Member list updates instantly when users join or leave
- 5-second grace period on disconnect — page refresh doesn't show as offline
- Room deleted notification pushed to all members regardless of current page
- Personal socket rooms (`user:<id>`) for cross-page events

### ✅ Activity Dashboard
- Total study time, session count, rooms joined, current streak
- 7-day bar chart (seconds-accurate, sub-minute sessions count)
- Donut chart for top subjects by room
- Recent sessions and room quick-links
- Streak counts days with any study activity in your rooms

## Additional Features

Beyond the mandatory requirements, the following enhancements were implemented:

### 📅 Calendar
- Month and week view with session chips per day
- Color-coded chips per room (consistent hash-based colors)
- Schedule future sessions with room picker, datetime, and optional note
- Past date restriction enforced on both client and server
- Day detail panel showing session history and scheduled sessions
- Timezone-aware — uses client's UTC offset for accurate date bucketing
- Inline room creation from the schedule modal

### 🏆 Leaderboard
- **My Rooms** tab — ranks participants within your rooms
- **Global** tab — ranks all users across the entire platform
- Visual podium for top 3 (🥇🥈🥉) with animated crown
- Filter by period: This week / This month / All time
- Filter by specific room (My Rooms scope)
- Your position highlighted with a ✓ badge

### ⚙️ Settings
- **Profile** — update name and bio; email is non-editable
- **Change password** — requires current password verification
- **Appearance** — theme selector (dark), density picker
- **Privacy** — show/hide online status; affects presence dots in real-time

### 🎯 Focus Status in Participant List
- Each participant shows their personal study time: `🟢 34m`
- Paused state shown as `🟡 Paused`
- Updates every second via Socket.io tick

### 🔔 Room Deletion Safety
- Owner cannot delete a room while a session is active
- Confirmation modal lists what will be permanently deleted
- All members receive instant notification and are redirected

### 📊 Smart Activity Feed
- Deduplicates consecutive same-user same-event within 30 seconds
- 8-second grace period on leave — page refresh doesn't log "left the room"
- Filters out noisy events (message sent) to keep feed meaningful
- Session end shows duration: "ended their session · 2m 34s"

### 🔗 Calendar ↔ Rooms Integration
- Create room modal includes "Schedule first session?" toggle
- Calendar schedule modal has inline room creation
- Room cards show next scheduled session: "📅 Tomorrow, 7:00 PM"

## Design Decisions

**No Docker** — MongoDB Atlas M0 is used as the cloud database. No local containers needed, which simplifies setup and works well on free hosting tiers.

**Per-user session timers** — Each participant has an independent timer. Starting or ending your session doesn't affect others. Sessions are auto-saved if you disconnect.

**Server-authoritative presence** — Online status is tracked in a server-side Map with a 5-second grace period on disconnect. Page refreshes don't cause flicker to offline.

**Personal socket rooms** — Every connected socket joins `user:<userId>`. This allows the server to push events (like room deletion) to a user regardless of which page they're on.

**Cursor-based pagination** — Messages use `_id`-based cursors instead of offset pagination. Stable under concurrent inserts.

**sessionStorage for auth** — Access token is persisted in sessionStorage (not localStorage). Survives page refreshes and new tabs opened from the same session, but clears when the browser is closed.

**Duplicate event prevention** — Join/leave activity logs have an 8-second grace period. Reconnects within that window cancel the leave log entirely, preventing "left → joined" spam in the activity feed.
